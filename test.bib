              As more analysis tools are becoming available, it is becoming
              increasingly difficult to navigate this landscape and produce an
              up-to-date workflow to analyse one's data. Here, we detail the

              pre-processing (quality control, normalization, data correction,
              feature selection, and dimensionality reduction) and cell- and
              gene-level downstream analysis. We formulate current
              best-practice recommendations for these steps based on

               INTRODUCTION During embryogenesis, pluripotent cells gradually
               become specialized and acquire distinct functions and
               morphologies. Because much of the specification process is
               controlled through changes in gene expression, the
               identification of the transcriptional trajectories underlying
               cell fate acquisition is paramount to understanding and
               manipulating development. \#\#\# RATIONALE Traditional
               approaches have studied specific fate decisions by analyzing the
               transcription of a few selected marker genes or by profiling
               isolated, predefined cell populations. The advent of large-scale
               single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) provides the means to
               comprehensively define the gene expression states of all
               embryonic cells as they acquire their fates. This technology
               raises the possibility of identifying the molecular trajectories
               that describe cell fate specification by sampling densely during
               embryogenesis and connecting the transcriptomes of cells that
               have similar gene expression profiles. However, the numerous
               transcriptional states and branch points, as well as the
               asynchrony in developmental processes, pose major challenges to
               the computational reconstruction of developmental trajectories
               from scRNA-seq data. \#\#\# RESULTS We generated single-cell
               transcriptomes from 38,731 cells during early zebrafish
               embryogenesis at high temporal resolution, spanning 12 stages
               from the onset of zygotic transcription through early
               somitogenesis. We took two complementary approaches to identify
               the transcriptional trajectories in the data. First, we
               developed a simulated diffusion-based computational approach,
               URD, which identified the trajectories describing the
               specification of 25 cell types in the form of a branching tree.
               Second, we identified modules of coexpressed genes and connected
               them across developmental time. Combining the reconstructed
               developmental trajectories with differential gene expression
               analysis uncovered gene expression cascades leading to each cell
               type, including previously unidentified markers and candidate
               regulators. Combining these trajectories with Seurat, which
               infers the spatial positions of cells on the basis of their
               transcriptomes, connected the earlier spatial position of
               progenitors to the later fate of their descendants. Inspection
               of the developmental tree led to new insights about molecular
               specification in zebrafish. For example, the first branch point
               in the tree indicated that the first molecular specification
               event may not only separate the germ layers but also define the
               axial versus nonaxial mesendoderm. Additionally, some
               developmental branch points contained intermediate cells that
               expressed genes characteristic of multiple downstream cell
               fates. Gene expression analysis at one such branch point (the
               axial mesoderm) suggested that the intermediate cells switch
               their specification from one fate (notochord) to another
               (prechordal plate). Last, analysis of single-cell transcriptomes
               from a Nodal-signaling mutant revealed that even at the
               whole-transcriptome level, mutant cells were canalized into a
               subset of wild-type states and did not adopt any transcriptional
               states not observed in wild type, despite abnormal developmental
               signaling. \#\#\# CONCLUSION These findings reconstruct the gene
               expression trajectories during the embryogenesis of a vertebrate
               and highlight the concurrent canalization and plasticity of cell
               type specification. The scRNA-seq data and developmental tree
               provide a rich resource for future studies in zebrafish: The raw
               and processed data and the URD software are available for
               download, and the data can be browsed interactively online.
               Last, this approach provides a broadly applicable framework with
               which to reconstruct complex developmental trajectories from
               single-cell transcriptomes. ![Figure][5] Developmental tree of
               early zebrafish embryogenesis. Single-cell transcriptomes were
               generated from zebrafish embryos at 12 developmental stages (six
               of which are shown). The transcriptional trajectories that
               describe the fate specification of 25 cell types were
               reconstructed from the data. Molecular specification is
               visualized with a force-directed layout, in which each cell is
               represented by a point (colored by developmental stage),
               proceeding from pluripotent cells (at the bottom center) outward
               to 25 distinct cell types. A subset of the identified
               trajectories are labeled in groups. During embryogenesis, cells
               acquire distinct fates by transitioning through transcriptional
               states. To uncover these transcriptional trajectories during
               zebrafish embryogenesis, we sequenced 38,731 cells and developed
               URD, a simulated diffusion-based computational reconstruction
               method. URD identified the trajectories of 25 cell types through
               early somitogenesis, gene expression along them, and their
               spatial origin in the blastula. Analysis of Nodal signaling
               mutants revealed that their transcriptomes were canalized into a
               subset of wild-type transcriptional trajectories. Some wild-type
               developmental branch points contained cells that express genes
               characteristic of multiple fates. These cells appeared to
               trans-specify from one fate to another. These findings
               reconstruct the transcriptional trajectories of a vertebrate
               embryo, highlight the concurrent canalization and plasticity of
               embryonic specification, and provide a framework with which to
               reconstruct complex developmental trees from single-cell
               transcriptomes. [1]: /lookup/doi/10.1126/science.aar4362 [2]:

  abstract = "The molecular mechanism underlying somite development differs
              along the embryonic antero-posterior axis. In zebrafish, cell
              lineage tracing and genetic analysis have revealed a difference
              in somite development between the trunk and tail. For instance,
              spadetail/tbx16 (spt) mutant embryos lack trunk somites but not
              tail ones. Trunk and tail somites are developed from mesodermal
              progenitor cells (MPCs) located in the tailbud. While the
              undifferentiated state of MPCs is maintained by mutual activation
              between Wnt and Brachyury/Ntl, the mechanism by which the MPCs
              differentiate into presomitic mesoderm (PSM) cells remains
              largely unclear. Especially, the molecules that promote PSM
              differentiation during tail development should be clarified.
              Here, we show that zebrafish embryos defective in mesogenin1
              (msgn1) and spt failed to differentiate into PSM cells in tail
              development and show increased expression of wnt8 and ntl. Msgn1
              acted in a cell-autonomous manner and as a transcriptional
              activator in PSM differentiation. The expression of msgn1
              initially overlapped with that of ntl in the ventral tailbud, as
              previously reported; and its mis-expression caused ectopic
              expression of tbx24, a PSM marker gene, only in the tailbud and
              posterior notochord, both of which expressed ntl in zebrafish
              embryos. Furthermore, the PSM-inducing activity of misexpressed
              msgn1 was enhanced by co-expression with ntl. Thus, Msgn1
              exercised its PSM-inducing activity in cells expressing ntl.
              Based on these results, we speculate that msgn1 expression in
              association with that of ntl may allow the differentiation of
              progenitor cells to proceed during development of somites in the
              tail.",

              segmented into somites, within which proliferative muscle
              progenitors and muscle fibers establish the skeletal musculature.
              Here, we demonstrate that a gene network previously implicated in
              somite boundary formation, involving the transcriptional
              regulators Tbx6, Mesp-b and Ripply1, also confers spatial and
              temporal regulation to skeletal myogenesis in zebrafish. We show
              that Tbx6 directly regulates mesp-b and ripply1 expression in
              vivo, and that the interactions within the regulatory network are
              largely conserved among vertebrates. Mesp-b is necessary and
              sufficient for the specification of a subpopulation of muscle
              progenitors, the central proportion of the Pax3(+)/Pax7(+)
              dermomyotome. Conditional ubiquitous expression indicates that
              Mesp-b acts by inhibiting myogenic differentiation and by
              inducing the dermomyotome marker meox1. By contrast, Ripply1
              induces a negative-feedback loop by promoting Tbx6 protein
              degradation. Persistent Tbx6 expression in Ripply1 knockdown
              embryos correlates with a deficit in dermomyotome and myotome
              marker gene expression, suggesting that Ripply1 promotes
              myogenesis by terminating Tbx6-dependent inhibition of myogenic
              maturation. Together, our data suggest that Mesp-b is an
              intrinsic upstream regulator of skeletal muscle progenitors and
              that, in zebrafish, the genes regulating somite boundary

              understanding of the organization, function and evolution of
              plant genes is essential to disentangle important biological
              processes and to advance crop engineering and breeding
              strategies. The ultimate aim in deciphering complex biological
              processes is the discovery of causal genes and regulatory
              mechanisms controlling these processes. The recent surge of omics
              data has opened the door to a system-wide understanding of the
              flow of biological information underlying complex traits.
              However, dealing with the corresponding large data sets
              represents a challenging endeavor that calls for the development
              of powerful bioinformatics methods. A popular approach is the
              construction and analysis of gene networks. Such networks are
              often used for genome-wide representation of the complex
              functional organization of biological systems. Network based on
              similarity in gene expression are called (gene) co-expression
              networks. One of the major application of gene co-expression
              networks is the functional annotation of unknown genes.
              Constructing co-expression networks is generally straightforward.
              In contrast, the resulting network of connected genes can become
              very complex, which limits its biological interpretation. Several
              strategies can be employed to enhance the interpretation of the
              networks. A strategy in coherence with the biological question
              addressed needs to be established to infer reliable networks.
              Additional benefits can be gained from network-based strategies
              using prior knowledge and data integration to further enhance the
              elucidation of gene regulatory relationships. As a result,
              biological networks provide many more applications beyond the
              simple visualization of co-expressed genes. In this study we
              review the different approaches for co-expression network
              inference in plants. We analyse integrative genomics strategies

              adaptation for scRNA-seq of our biological network module
              detection algorithm MTGO. MTGO-SC isolates gene functional
              modules by leveraging on both the network topological structure
              and the annotations characterizing the nodes (genes). These
              annotations are provided by an external source, such as databases
              and literature repositories (e.g., the Gene Ontology, Reactome).
              Thanks to the depth of single-cell data, it is possible to define
              one network for each cell cluster (typically, cell type or state)
              composing each sample, as opposed to traditional bulk RNA-seq,
              where the emerging gene network is averaged over the whole

              data, such as gene expression or single nucleotide polymorphisms

              therefore, to better characterize diseases or assess genetic
              structure. There are different ways to perform variable selection
              in large data sets. Statistical tests are commonly used to
              identify differentially expressed features for explanatory
              purposes, whereas Machine Learning wrapper approaches can be used
              for predictive purposes. In the case of multiple highly
              correlated variables, another option is to use multivariate
              exploratory approaches to give more insight into cell biology,
              biological pathways or complex traits. RESULTS: A simple
              extension of a sparse PLS exploratory approach is proposed to
              perform variable selection in a multiclass classification

              into a densely packed honeycomb of alveolar air sacs that mediate
              gas exchange. Although this transformation has been studied by
              marker expression analysis and fate-mapping, the mechanisms that
              control the progression of lung progenitors along distinct
              lineages into mature alveolar cell types are still incompletely

              show that single-cell transcriptome analysis circumvents these
              problems and enables direct measurement of the various cell types
              and hierarchies in the developing lung. We used microfluidic
              single-cell RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) on 198 individual cells at
              four different stages encompassing alveolar differentiation to
              measure the transcriptional states which define the developmental
              and cellular hierarchy of the distal mouse lung epithelium. We
              empirically classified cells into distinct groups by using an
              unbiased genome-wide approach that did not require a priori
              knowledge of the underlying cell types or the previous

              outlines of the classical model of epithelial cell-type diversity

              elucidated the full life cycle of the alveolar type 2 cell

              majority of adherent cells. The apparent FcR-negative,
              low-density and weakly phagocytic nature of the strongly
              HLA-DQ/DP+ cells, combined with their lack of reactivity with
              several MO-specific antibodies, suggests that they may represent
              the DC component of TA. Such strong HLA-DQ/DP expression by DC
              may aid their positive identification in human peripheral blood
              and may be of relevance to DC function in antigen presentation.",

  abstract = "Single-cell RNA-sequencing has become a widely used, powerful
              approach for studying cell populations. However, these methods
              often generate multiplet artifacts, where two or more cells
              receive the same barcode, resulting in a hybrid transcriptome. In
              most experiments, multiplets account for several percent of
              transcriptomes and can confound downstream data analysis. Here,
              we present Single-Cell Remover of Doublets (Scrublet), a
              framework for predicting the impact of multiplets in a given
              analysis and identifying problematic multiplets. Scrublet avoids
              the need for expert knowledge or cell clustering by simulating
              multiplets from the data and building a nearest neighbor
              classifier. To demonstrate the utility of this approach, we test
              Scrublet on several datasets that include independent knowledge
              of cell multiplets. Scrublet is freely available for download at
              github.com/AllonKleinLab/scrublet.",

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: The analysis of modular gene co-expression networks
              is a well-established method commonly used for discovering the
              systems-level functionality of genes. In addition, these studies
              provide a basis for the discovery of clinically relevant
              molecular pathways underlying different diseases and conditions.
              RESULTS: In this paper, we present a fast and easy-to-use
              Bioconductor package named CEMiTool that unifies the discovery
              and the analysis of co-expression modules. Using the same real
              datasets, we demonstrate that CEMiTool outperforms existing
              tools, and provides unique results in a user-friendly html report
              with high quality graphs. Among its features, our tool evaluates
              whether modules contain genes that are over-represented by
              specific pathways or that are altered in a specific sample group,
              as well as it integrates transcriptomic data with interactome
              information, identifying the potential hubs on each network. We
              successfully applied CEMiTool to over 1000 transcriptome
              datasets, and to a new RNA-seq dataset of patients infected with
              Leishmania, revealing novel insights of the disease's
              physiopathology. CONCLUSION: The CEMiTool R package provides
              users with an easy-to-use method to automatically implement gene
              co-expression network analyses, obtain key information about the
              discovered gene modules using additional downstream analyses and
              retrieve publication-ready results via a high-quality interactive

              is effective in reducing dimensionality, removing irrelevant

  author   = "Shmulevich, Ilya and Zhang, Wei",
  abstract = "MOTIVATION: Most approaches to gene expression analysis use
              real-valued expression data, produced by high-throughput
              screening technologies, such as microarrays. Often, some measure
              of similarity must be computed in order to extract meaningful
              information from the observed data. The choice of this similarity
              measure frequently has a profound effect on the results of the
              analysis, yet no standards exist to guide the researcher.
              RESULTS: To address this issue, we propose to analyse gene
              expression data entirely in the binary domain. The natural
              measure of similarity becomes the Hamming distance and reflects
              the notion of similarity used by biologists. We also develop a
              novel data-dependent optimization-based method, based on Genetic
              Algorithms (GAs), for normalizing gene expression data. This is a
              necessary step before quantizing gene expression data into the
              binary domain and generally, for comparing data between different
              arrays. We then present an algorithm for binarizing gene
              expression data and illustrate the use of the above methods on
              two different sets of data. Using Multidimensional Scaling, we
              show that a reasonable degree of separation between different
              tumor types in each data set can be achieved by working solely in
              the binary domain. The binary approach offers several advantages,
              such as noise resilience and computational efficiency, making it
              a viable approach to extracting meaningful biological information
              from gene expression data.",
